**To Get Free Paper Space Credit Follow Below Steps:**
- Go to [https://www.paperspace.com/&R=FASTAI1550](https://www.paperspace.com/&R=FASTAI1550)
- Once account is created go to Billing, Don’t add your credit card as of now just go to billing
add this as promo code UMR4I5U you would get 10$
- Now on the Machine tab create your machine as instructed in the video
- Below the credit card tab there is another promo tab, once you do this then add your credit card details. You would have 25$ to play with your machine remember as soon as the machine is created you are charged 5$ for storage and 3$ for public IP
